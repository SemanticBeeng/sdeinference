0.0 fix up intro
-> not enough examples yet of Bayesian inference and associated computational
statistics techniques in Spark

basic idea

0.1 add info on Scala and Spark stuff w/ Shagun's diagrams

big mining needs to involve new mathematical derivations as well as clever implementations, i.e., need both for scalability.  cannot simply take old algorithms and implement in scala/spark.  similarly, some new algorithms will not work with new software frameworks and hardware infrastructure.

mention GitHub

2. plots:
-> scalability *****
1) length of time series
2) number of processors!
