0.0 fix up intro

basic idea

0.1 add info on Scala and Spark stuff w/ Shagun's diagrams

big mining needs to involve new mathematical derivations as well as clever implementations, i.e., need both for scalability.  cannot simply take old algorithms and implement in scala/spark.  similarly, some new algorithms will not work with new software frameworks and hardware infrastructure.

0.2 conclusion / future directions

mention GitHub

1. add in details of numerical experiments
-> priors
-> proposals
-> initial conditions
-> how fake data was generated
CHECK THE ABOVE -- MAKE SURE PARAMETERS AGREE

2. plots:
-> posteriors, check
-> time series plot *****
-> scalability *****
(trace plots???)

3. additional results:
-> real-world?
-> nonparametric?
