0.0 fix up intro
-> not enough examples yet of Bayesian inference and associated computational
statistics techniques in Spark

basic idea

0.1 add info on Scala and Spark stuff w/ Shagun's diagrams

big mining needs to involve new mathematical derivations as well as clever implementations, i.e., need both for scalability.  cannot simply take old algorithms and implement in scala/spark.  similarly, some new algorithms will not work with new software frameworks and hardware infrastructure.

scala/breeze/intel mkl
spark/RDD/mapping/nonequispaced

0.2 conclusion / future directions
-> could turn this into a streaming algorithm, haven't explored yet

mention GitHub

1. add in details of numerical experiments
-> priors
-> proposals
-> initial conditions
-> how fake data was generated
CHECK THE ABOVE -- MAKE SURE PARAMETERS AGREE

2. plots:
-> posteriors, check
-> time series plot, check if it compiles
-> scalability *****
1) length of time series
2) number of processors!
(trace plots???)
