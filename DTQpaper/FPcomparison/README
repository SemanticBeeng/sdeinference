To reproduce Figure 2 in the DTQ paper, follow these steps.

For each subdirectory in the set {"polydomain","logdomain"}:
- enter the subdirectory
- edit the file "runner.R"
- for each R file in the set {"integrandmat.R",
                              "integrandmatcpp.R",
                              "integrandmatsparse.R"}:
  - change line 5 of the "runner.R" file to source the corresponding integrandmat R file
    (to spell it out, the choices are:
     source('integrandmat.R')
     source('integrandmatcpp.R')
     source('integrandmatsparse.R')
  - change line 43 of the "runner.R" file to save the data in a corresponding RData file
    (to spell it out, the choices are:
     save.image(file='timingresults.RData')
     save.image(file='timingresultscpp.RData')
     save.image(file='timingresultssparse.RData')
  - once these changes have been made, run this at the command line:

Rscript runner.R > runner.out

There should be a total of 6 Rscript runs: 2 subdirectories * 3 integrandmats

Once all of these runs have been completed, get back to this directory.

At the command line, run:

Rscript processdata.R

This should create "timings.eps" and "timings.pdf"
